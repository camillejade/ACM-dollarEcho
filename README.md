This system is the Training System for the FEU Institute of Technology EAGER iTam (Programming Team). This can also serve as an online Programming Contest Management System. Another purpose would be recreational programming.

Solve problems using almost all the programming languages and see your program's runtime. The shorter runtime, the better.
